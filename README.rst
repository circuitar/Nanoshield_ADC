Nanoshield_ADC
==============

This is the Arduino software library to access the ADC Nanoshield (ADS1x15 IC) from Texas Instruments.

* Source code: https://github.com/circuitar/Nanoshield_ADC
* Documentation: http://nanoshield-adc.readthedocs.org/
* Reference boards: `ADC Nanoshield`_ and `4-20 ADC Nanoshield`_ from Circuitar_

Library features include:

* Analog to digital conversion with 16 bits resolution.
* Continuous mode to capture measures with a given sample rate.
* Gain adjust to pair the signal magnitude with the resolution.
* Differential voltage measurements.
* High threshold setting to trigger interruptions.

To install, just click **Download ZIP** and install it using **Sketch > Include Library... > Add .ZIP Library** in the Arduino IDE.

This library is based on the `Adafruit_ADS1X15`_ library from Adafruit.

The following examples_ are provided:

- Voltage_: read a voltage in single-ended mode.
- VoltageWithHighGain_: read a voltage in single-ended mode with a high gain. Increasing the gain allows reading smaller voltages with increased resolution.
- Voltage4Ch_: read four voltages in a single ADC Nanoshield.
- Voltage16Ch_: using multiple boards. Read sixteen voltages across four units of the ADC Nanoshield. Make sure that the jumpers for the I2C address are properly configured to support this example.
- DifferentialVoltage_: read a differential voltage between inputs 2 (+) and 3 (-). The channels can be easily changed to 0 (+) and 1 (-).
- Read4to20mA_: how to read data from industrial 4-20mA sensors (or 4-20mA "transmistters"). Make sure to use the 4-20 ADC Nanoshield board for this example.
- ContinuousMode_: read data in continuous mode to achieve high sample rates.
- ContinuousMode4Ch_: read multiple channels in continuous mode.
- Comparator_: trigger interruptions on arduino using the ADC Nanoshield in comparator mode.
- RawAdcValue_: read the raw ADC value in single-ended mode.
